# 0xRails ðŸ§™

_A Solidity framework for creating complex and evolving onchain structures._

Rails is a modular smart contract system leveraging cutting edge blockchain technology like **ERC4337 account abstraction** and **ERC6551 token bound accounts** in combination with more familiar patterns like **EIP712 signature validation** as well as **Modules**, **Access**, **Guards**, and **Extensions** to provide a comprehensive suite of onchain mechanisms for any organization.

[Get started with our documentation](https://docs.groupos.xyz/contract-architecture/framework/modules)

Rails's intuition began cultivating in mid-2021 in response to designing for modular token design and vault management problems.
Currently, Rails is being developed and applied in production for [GroupOS](https://groupos.xyz/), a protocol and product for creating autonomous networks.

## Contributing

While Rails is in initial R&D, assistance on reviews for security and developer experience are most appreciated. Upon first release, Rails will support public contributions and commentary and likely incorporate a token-incentive model for fun and recognition. In the meantime, please reach out directly via [Twitter DM](https://twitter.com/ilikesymmetry).

## License
